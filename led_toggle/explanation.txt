some explanations of the drive configuration

The different options specify how a configured GPIO pin sinks current when you set it low (write 0 to the pin) and how a configured pin sources current when you set it high (write 1 to the pin).
Standard means the pin will be sourced or sinked with up to 0.5 mA for the assigned signal (high or low)
High source means the pin will be sourced with up to 5.0 mA for high signal
High sink means the pin will be sinked with up to 15.0 mA for low signal
Disconnected means there is no drive, the pin is high impedance. Consequently, there is no current flowing to or from the pin, no matter the drive of any external circuit connected to the pin
